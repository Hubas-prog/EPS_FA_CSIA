'Identification_EPS_CSIA.R' file contains the in-house R script used for data processing, univariate and multivariate statistics as well as figures. The script call the dataset hosted in https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7351530. The study took place in June 2017 at 2 tidal flat sites (i.e. muddy vs. sandy sediments) in France near La Coupelasse (Baie of Bourgneuf, France). Sediment samples were taken and processed to obtain microphytobenthic biofilm exopolymeric substances (EPS) C and N stable isotope ratio as well as EPS C and N contents (https://zenodo.org/record/7351531/files/Fatty_acids_SI_ratio.csv?download=1). Carbohydrate and protein content of EPS were also measured (https://zenodo.org/record/7351531/files/EPS_colorimetry.csv?download=1). Biofilm fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were also extracted and identified. Their C natural stable isotope ratio was also measured (https://zenodo.org/record/7351531/files/Fatty_acids_SI_ratio.csv?download=1)
