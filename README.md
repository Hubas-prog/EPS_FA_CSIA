The study took place in June 2017 at two tidal sites (muddy and sandy sediments) in France, near La Coupelasse (Baie de Bourgneuf, France). Sediment samples were collected and processed to obtain stable C and N isotope ratios of exopolymeric substances (EPS) in microphytobenthic biofilms (MPB) as well as the C and N contents of MPB's EPS (https://zenodo.org/record/7351531/files/Fatty_acids_SI_ratio.csv?download=1). Carbohydrate and protein content of EPS were also measured (https://zenodo.org/record/7351531/files/EPS_colorimetry.csv?download=1). Biofilm fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were also extracted and identified. Their natural C stable isotope ratio was also measured (https://zenodo.org/record/7351531/files/Fatty_acids_SI_ratio.csv?download=1). In addition, chlorophyll a concentration (https://zenodo.org/record/8116986/files/chla.csv?download=1) and the proportion of key fatty acid biomarkers such as 16:0/16:1w7 ratio and % of branched fatty acids are also available (https://zenodo.org/record/8116986/files/bra.csv?download=1)
